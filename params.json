  "body": "# MCQ project using Django   \r\n \r\n## Our Requirements :   \r\n  * We have questions and tags ( Taggable Manager )  \r\n  * We need questions who have only a particular tags and exclude those questions which have an extra or less tags  \r\n\r\n## Challenges faced before this :   \r\n * Initially, we were unable to figure out how to achieve this.   \r\n * How to fetch only those questions which meet our Requirements  \r\n * You can't actually exclude each tag manually, so you have to pick each and everyone and then filter them out.  \r\n * If you try to loop on every question and check, then it's not a scalable option  \r\n * We wanted a more pythonic way that could solve our problem. Though this is not the best one, but still a lot better than our previous ones  \r\n\r\n## Focus :   \r\n * Though this repo has the basic functionality of MCQ, but the focus of this repo is not to create MCQs but to filter out   \r\n   questions with specific tags.  \r\n * This repo can be used to understand the table structure for designing MCQs and to filter out MCQs from the questions pool.  \r\n\r\n\r\n## How things work :   \r\n * We already have a pool of [multiple choice] questions (or we can also add new [multiple choice] questions).  \r\n * When we create a new contest, we want to filter questions with different tags and add them to the contest pool.  \r\n * The process of adding [multiple choice] questions to the pool would be following :   \r\n    * The admin specifies the number of questions he/she wants to select and also specify the tags on which they want to filter out questions.  \r\n    * The system tells the number of questions available and ask if they want to add these questions to the contest pool.  \r\n * Once these question-contest pools are created, questions are then served from these pools to the user randomly .\r\n\r\n\r\n## Urls : \r\n * /contest/create :  create a new contest \r\n * /contest/( contest-slug )   : a particular contest \r\n * /skilltest/( skilltest-slug ): skilltest home \r\n * /skilltest/( skilltest-slug )/join : Join skilltest (To be used by candidate)\r\n * /skilltest/( skilltest-slug )/mcq/ : MCQ's home\r\n * /skilltest/( skilltest-slug )/mcq/(mcq-id)/submit : Submit MCQ's answer\r\n * /skilltest/( skilltest-slug )/mcq/(mcq-id)/review : Review MCQ's answer (Shortlist for review)\r\n * /skilltest/( skilltest-slug )/mcq/finish : Finish skilltest\r\n * /mcq/(skilltest-slug)/create-pool : create contest pool for the particular contest. ( Used by admin  )\r\n * /mcq/(skilltest-slug)/save-pool : save contest pool \r\n * /mcq/add_multiple : create multiple MCQs from CSV \r\n",
